CS193P - iOS 7 Programming - Stanford Lectures

- This is my attempt at solving the assignments which are part of Stanford's CS193P lectures. 
- The iOS simulator being used is the iPhone 4" - running on older iPhone versions, or on the iPad may result 
in the loss of UI controls. 
- Some of the commits are out of order, and the "initial commit" contains parts of the assignments as well. 
  Sorry about that. I've been more careful since.
